Alternatively, [finetuning](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Fine_tuning) BERT can provide both an accuracy boost and faster training time in many cases.\n",

I was always very happy with the results, yet I was kept trying to look for a more reasonably priced place because it is very expensive indeed (in my case about $300 with the toner and blow dry, which is not included).\\n\\nAnd so it was that a month before my wedding I went to a very reputable downtown salon (supposedly the best in to) to have my highlights done. To make a very long and painful story short, my hair was butchered, orange, brassy, horrible. I did actually cry...so I went to Ina, to see if she could do anything to fix it, and she did.

Yes - this many dishes shared between 4 people. We started with bread, as well as an app on the house (grilled zucchini with squash on top). Everything was delicious. I would prefer to try the grilled calamari next time though. In terms of the lobster risotto, it's not a traditional risotto but made in tomato sauce. If you love lobster, this dish or the lobster pasta is your ideal meal. It comes with a whole lobster! I would also recommend the linguine with clams, and the mushroom gnocchi was so delicious.

I was advised that Parker and Sons was the company used to install Home Depot water heaters. The technician came to my house this morning, conducted a 5 minute walk through of both existing water heaters then spent 20 minutes in his truck writing an estimate. The estimate was $5,538! When I asked the technician how in the world the price could be so high, he responded, \"that\\'s our pricing on \"\"our\"\" water heaters. I told him this estimate was set up by Home Depot not Parker and Sons. He continued to tell me the pricing was for Parker and Sons water heaters. The water heater from Home Depot was $850 each, how could Parker and Sons charge an additional approx. $2,000 per unit to install? They said it was to bring my current water heater up to code and pull a permit.  I called the city of Scottsdale and they informed me the only cost that would be needed was a water pressure valve ($14) and a permit ($44). The remaining items on my current units are up to code and would easily pass in inspection. Parker and Sons pays it\\'s technicians commission for every job they are on. They will try to increase the price to receive that commission. This is a predatory business practice.

The chicken is juicy on the inside, and has a really good crunch on the outside. The sandwich is garnished with cucumber, lettuce, and isn't over saturated with seasoning/sauces. For add-ins, the wasabi honey is my favorite. It's just a hint of heat and sweetness, although the sandwich is good alone. Also, I am a fan of their fries and coleslaw. The fries are thin, shoe-string type and they are crispy on the outside and mashed potato-y on the inside, and not so greasy. I am usually not a fan of coleslaw mostly because I do not like mayo, but this coleslaw was pretty good! It is vinegary and not very creamy at all, which might not appeal to some people but was good for me. They also have their own recipe sodas and sweet and ice tea. The root beer is bomb.\",\n",

Another review compared it to Chilis and that comparison is probably pretty apt but I think of it more as a cheese cake factory- they don't really specialize in anything (food wise)-they have an enormous menu with a bunch of diverse options, none of which knock your socks off but all of which are passable.BJs is a great compromise spot when trying to negotiate a meal with a large group- it has something for everyone .\\n\\n\\nAll that being said we all know what we really love about BJs- the pizookie. If it wasn't for this dessert no one would have heard of this restaurant/it would of gone the way of the dodo. The pizookie is a skillet cookie Sunday that you can get in a bunch of different flavors- both cookie and ice cream. They even have a sampler pizookie that comes with 3 different cookie and ice cream combinations so you can get a variety. However, for the discerning foodie the only real option is the white chocolate macadamia nut one- the cookie comes not quite baked through, very soft and gooey in the middle. This means the white chocolate will be basically molten (be careful you don't burn 1/2 your face off Harvey Dent style by shoveling it in too fast... I know from experience) and though the whole cookie itself is soft the nuts will give you that crunch for textural contrast that is so key. \\n\\nIn closing- PI ZOOKIE MOFO\",\n",

It\\'s so difficult for any experience to match the one I can create in my head while reading everyone eloquently explaining the meaning of life found in a piece of beef tongue.  Oddly enough I had the opposite experience with Yuzu.   Despite it\\'s high marks thus far on here, the reviewers that I know and love (okay, I\\'m talking Elite here) for the most part gave it a measly 4 stars.   Bah, why even bother?   It\\'s a sad state of affairs when even a 4 star review isn\\'t enough to get my juices flowing.   Well here it was, 9pm on a Friday night and wanting something quick and close to the house to grab a bite.  \\n\\nFrom the moment I walked in the door I had roughly 10 \"wow\" moments.  From the way they transformed what used to be a sandwich shop into a cute and quaint Japanese spot to every single dish, my mild expectations were pleasantly blown out of the water every few minutes.\\n\\nI started with a simple salad.  The kind waitress was eager to explain all dishes which arrived and I found that to be a nice touch.   She explained that the dressing was homemade and made of Yuzu, which was apropos.   I know I\\'ve had yuzu dressing before and this one was tangier and tasted better than I\\'m used to which set it apart from the standard Japanese side salad I\\'m accustomed to.  Next was the Miso soup.  My version which was part of some sort of combo with one of our entrees (add $3 to any entree gets you salad, soup, and rice) did not come with Tofu, but my friend that accompanied me ordered one a la carte which comes with tofu.   Ironically enough she hates tofu and I love it, so we switched.  The tofu was fantastic, which I might be wrong in assuming is their handmade Zaru tofu.  If it was not homemade, it definitely fooled me.  At this point in most Japanese restaurants I\\'ve eaten the salad and miso soup just because they\\'re there, but here at Yuzu they felt like important components to the meal.   \\n\\nNext our entrees started arriving, and first was the Kobe Beef Aburi.  Perfectly seared and with these little garlic chips which complemented it wonderfully.  I also received my side of rice around this time and I know you\\'ll just think I\\'m pulling your leg at this point, but even the rice seemed a step above.  To make sure I hadn\\'t accidentally ingested something laced with pot on the drive over, I had my friend try it and she confirmed that it did taste better than \"just rice\".   This is a master at work in the kitchen.\\n\\nNext up was one of our standard orders of Yellowtail jalapeno.  The fish melted in my mouth and the flavor was spectacular.  I did think that the jalapenos were a little too small and didn\\'t provide the kick that I normally like, but it was still delectable.  Our last entree was the Salmon Foil Broil, which is boiled with several veggies.   Good god was this delicious.  The salmon just fell apart and had a great flavor especially when combined with the veggies it\\'d been broiled with.   \"Wow\" was muttered for approximately the 8th time.   \\n\\nI decided I had to have the yuzu sorbet because at this point I was convinced everything was going to taste munchies-esque good.   I was right!   Being lactose intolerant I cannot resist sorbet, and the yuzu flavor was perfect.   The waitress also brought out a complimentary order of their soy milk pudding.  I\\'m not a huge fan of soy milk, but this one was light enough in the soy flavor and  topped with whipped cream which always helps.   I enjoyed it even though I had to pop a lactaid pill to do so.   \\n\\nThe final wow was brought on by the arrival of the bill.   All those fantastic dishes came out to a total of $48 or so after tax.   I even had to do the obligatory \"on the strip that would have cost $100 and been worth every penny\" comment.',\n",

Though it was really a last minute thing, Steve was polite and professional and said he was available, took down my number and said he'd be there at 4:30. Now, I've taken enough taxis in Chicago to know that often, especially with big taxi companies, taxis aren't there to pick you up when they say they will. I wasn't sure - would he show up on time? Would he show up at all? 4:30 is pretty early in the morning. If he didn't show, or was late, I was going to miss my shuttle up to Midway and it was for work - I couldn't miss my flight. \\n\\nWell, I didn't have to worry. Not only did Steve show up, he was early (didn't charge me for that, of course). His taxi was incredibly clean and fresher than probably any car I've been in, including my own. Steve himself was personable as well as professional. He was also very knowledgeable about the area and knew exactly where my shuttle would arrive at the station. \\n\\nBut here's what impressed me the most. We got to the shuttle stop and the shuttle hadn't arrived yet, so he stayed with me to make sure I got on the shuttle safely, at no charge for his time. He explained he wouldn't feel right dropping someone off in the dark without knowing they got to their destination or next transfer safely. Then, it turned out my shuttle was full! I asked him if he went all the way to Midway. He said yes, but that honestly to go that distance, there were some cheaper options. He actually even brainstormed with me about other options in the area! He stayed there to make sure I wouldn't be stranded, as I tried to figure out if any of those other options would work. When it turned out they wouldn't, he offer to lower his rate so that I could have one more option - it was still more expensive than Uber would have been (slightly - maybe about a total $30 difference), but I was glad to do it as by then I knew I trusted him as an individual. As a woman going all the way to Midway by myself that early in the morning, I didn't want to take my chances with some random Uber driver who might not be a safe driver or a safe person. It was a great ride there - good conversation (he's a super interesting guy and easy to talk to without being in-your-face chatty) and he's a safe driver (unlike the last Uber I took when I was traveling, that tailgated and zoomed in and out of lanes so quickly that I was sick the whole day after).  \\n\\nTL;DR: Definitely go with Steve of Executive Taxi if you want to ride in a clean vehicle, with a professional, caring, conscientious driver. I was so impressed by his honesty and integrity, generosity, and caring. He is also just a really cool person to talk to if you are going on a long ride. Also, I found out talking to Steve that he basically IS Executive Taxi, so if you call you're going to get only him or, if he has an emergency and can't make it, one of two other trusted affiliates. He doesn't farm out to dozens of other taxi services, thankfully.\\n\\nI'll always be thankful I went with Executive Taxi for my 4:30am travel fiasco, because he turned it into such a positive experience.

Well, when we tried to use our food credit at the restaurant, the restaurant initially tried to charge it to the room.  After we had already departed from the restaurant, the restaurant realized that because there was no credit card on file, they could not charge it to the room so they called the front desk. An employee at the front desk who really did not know her job too well, told them that they had to figure it out so the employee of the restaurant actually called the hotel room, at 2 a.m!

Eventually, after my wife spoke to a more well-versed employee at the front counter the entire situation was figured out.

There's a sensibility to the entire place that makes you intuitively understand that you're in the right place at the right time.  Seeing the owner bussing tables and getting her hands dirty, seeing waitstaff doing their best to assist patrons and refill water glasses.  These are good signs.  The beer, wine and liquor menu covered a lot of ground, and had something for anyone.  Starters included a roasted garlic app, which had good flavor, and was a nice compliment to their in-house bread.  Another good choice was the tossed green salad, which included reggiano-parm cheese, olives and cucumber slices.  Finally, a reliable pizza topped with sausage and green peppers.  Incidentally, they give you a choice of crust thickness, and even have a gluten free crust option.  The only disappointment was a corn and leek soup, which was too brothy and had no spice profile (as in NONE).  In spite of that, I'll be back.\",\n",

I don\\'t know about you guys, but I came here to try their pastries.. and 2 out of the 3 times I have gone there, they barely had anything left. If you\\'re going to heavily advertise your pastries everywhere on social media, maybe you should focus on having them readily available.\\n\\nFirst visit, they had no pastries available.. and we came around 3pm. Since we were already there, we decided to go ahead and try a drink. I asked the cashier what she recommended, and she said that the Ube Monster was popular - so thats what I ordered. I guess it\\'s supposed to be like a Ube and Cookies&Cream milkshake. I hated it. It had very little Ube flavor and just tasted like milk. The cookies weren\\'t even throughout the whole drink. All they did was put some cookies at the bottom of the cup, and on top. Pretty lame. Super disappointing and do not recommend. \\n\\n2nd visit, they had only ube truffles available.. and we came around 5pm. We also did the Yelp check-in for a free Hibiscus Cooler. The ube truffle had good ube flavor, but the texture wasn\\'t to my liking. My toddler ended up eating it all though. The Hibiscus Cooler was pretty terrible - it literally tasted like water. Another disappointing visit.\\n\\n3rd and final visit, we came in around 11am and was finally able to try the Ube Leche Flan Cupcakes. We also ordered the Mermaid Drink with Boba (Sea Salt Green Tea), an Ube Truffle, and got the free Hibiscus Cooler again (hoping it wouldn\\'t be watery like last time). Was super excited to try the cupcakes, since that was what this place is known for.. but was pretty let down. The cupcake was hard and dense! I felt like I was eating play-doh or something. I\\'m sorry, but that\\'s not how a cupcake should be. The only saving grace was the flan, but even that was just okay. We ended up just eating the flan and tossing the \"cupcakes\" away. Both drinks we got tasted watered down yet again, and the boba had no flavor. Yet another disappointing visit.\\n\\nAlso, what is up with the the theme of this place? It\\'s all over the place. It\\'s like they just took everything they like and threw it all together, even though it makes no sense at all. Star Wars, cars, Filipino sun, mermaid drink, _____ monster drinks, zebra drink?

Such a shame!\\n\\nTL;DR - They seldom have the pastries available that they widely advertise.

Boy, did they fail the test.\\n\\nIn October 2016 I dropped off two binders corresponding to my taxes filed in 2014 and 2015.  They were supposed to check 2015 only, but the tax consultant asked me to leave also 2014 in case she needed to reference to that year to clarify something.  After two months of not hearing anything from her, I sent her an email and she informed me that she had been transferred to another office and my binders had been assigned to another agent.  The new agent never contacted me, never did anything on my taxes and when I stopped by H&R she did not know where the binders were. After some looking around, she found them.  I reported that to my original agent and she contacted the office manager about my problem.\\n\\nI went online and, after reading the profiles of the agents in that office, I chose one with vast real estate experience since I own rental properties.  Subsequently, the office manager, without my consent or authorization, removed her name and re-assigned me to Claudia Melissa Argueta, now Claudia Melissa Bozic.  Being that it was a referral from the manager and she was aware of what I needed, I trusted her judgment and went along with her choice.  BAD CHOICE!\\n\\nClaudia Melissa Bozic received my binders on December 2 and by the end of February 2017 she had not done the review.\\n\\nOn January 11, 2017, I sent her a follow up email to see how things were going with the tax review. She did not respond to my email.   Afraid that she had left the office, like the first tax consultant did, I personally went to H&R. She was there, we spoke briefly and she said that she was working on the tax review.\\n\\nNot having heard anything from her, I was very disappointed about the tremendous amount of time she was taking to do a review.  I am not a tax person and I can do my taxes in a week.  On February 21, 2017, I wrote her an emailed  expressing my disappointment and requesting the return of my binders.  \\n\\nThe email was undeliverable.  Claudia Melissa Bozic had changed her email address and didn't have the courtesy of notifying me. She was the one who said when I met her that she preferred communication via email.\\n\\nI needed my binders urgently since I was in the process of refinancing one of my properties and the bank needed my tax documents.  I called H&R and Claudia Melissa Bozic was in California and no one could find my binders in the office.\\n\\nI requested to speak with the office manager and they finally found my binders after much inconvenience caused to me.\\n\\nIn summary, since October 2016 to February 2017, this office did NOTHING.  Just wasted my time and caused aggravation that I didn't need.  It's a free service, ok, but if they are not going to do the job, please do not offer the service and disrespect people's time.\\n\\nDue to my bad experience, I do not recommend H&R Block.\",\n",

After 5 and a half minutes,I hung up.  Poor potential patient experience!  I am calling for help, not to have my time wasted.  As an individual who works 60 hours a week, I don't have time to sit on hold, especially when you are only taking appointment calls between 8:30am and 4:30pm.  If she had come back on the line to provide an update, it may have evoked a better response but when you are forced to call for an appointment and cannot make an appointment online, the staff needs to be more on top of their game.\",\n",

As it relates to the previous reviews in relation to being unable to be approved for credit, this isn't a company issue, rather an issue a consumer should be aware they may experience based off their debt to income ratio. One thing I will say after purchasing the truck  is that it had 3 different types of  tires on it, so I was required to purchase a matching set.

I waited about 15 minutes before I asked someone if we even had a waitress.... My buddy told me there was only 1 waitress/bartender working. After another 5 min I decided to just go to her at the bar. As I was getting up she was heading our way. She explained that this was her first day back from not bartending for a few years and she was the only one scheduled for another hour and a half. This made me change my game plane and I started ordering 2 beers so I wouldn't have to wait for a refill quickly. I gotta say for it just being her she hustled the best she could and I give her props, however, management should have known Friday nights gets busy and they should have at least had a waitress scheduled. It wasn't really right for the employee or the customer to have to deal with this. \\n\\nI ordered a burger with green chile and continued my 2 beer orders and that went rather well... The burger took a long time, im guessing a little over 30 minutes. I was a little frustrated with that but the burger was actually really good. I asked for some condiments and never got them, im sure it was because the waitress/bartender was slammed so I wasn't too worried about it. \\n\\nAfter awhile a waitress and another bartender showed up to take over and everything started running a lot more smoothly. Beers were flowing, shots were going down smooth, and we got our ordered items quickly. Around 8pm Karaoke started and it was on!!! I chose a couple songs and handed them to the DJ... I was told my songs weren't available.... I gave him a couple more and nope.... So if your planning to Karaoke make sure your gonna stick to the same ol same ol songs... Thunder Rolls, Baby got back, Grease, or a balls song. The DJ offered me to pay for songs I wanted to sing. I was going to tip him anyway so I paid the 2 dollars for 1 of my songs.

I suggest the Corned Beef Reuben with Sauerkraut and Swiss on Rye with Potato Salad for $15 if you want a good deli style sandwich. The Fish of the Day (Halibut) with Wild Mushrooms and Pearl Onions, Creamy Corn Puree and Tomato Fondue for $31 was also very good. For salads, I thought the Chopped Vegetable Salad with Feta Cheese, Garlic Croutons and Creamy Greek Dressing was very good and can easily be shared with people as an appetizer.\\n\\nThe portions vary between the dishes. I thought the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sweet Fennel-Sausage Bolognese for $23 was a little on the small side compared to the Sweet Pea and Goat Cheese Filled Tortellini with Wild Mushrooms and Parmesan Reggiano for $25. You also can't go wrong with the Grilled Prime Burger with Vermont Cheddar and Smoked Onion Marmalade for $18. \\n\\nThe Crab cakes were delicious, $17 for 4 crab cakes.

Let\\'s start at the beginning. \\n\\nI got there right at 9am, supposedly when they open, and I watched as the employees sat around on the counters and chatted in what seemed to be a staff meeting. It was freezing outside and considering it was 9am I was expecting the door to open any minute. \\n\\nI waited and I waited. I watched as one by one, the employees noticed me standing outside, and one by one, they peeked their heads around and just stared. You\\'d think someone would have come to my rescue, but nope. They just continued sitting around on the counters and occasionally looking back to see if I was still there. \\n\\nI finally got inside at 9:10am (which SUCKS because by this point, I\\'m late for work) and I told them I had to return an item. The assistant manager said \"Malcolm will help you on the other side\". So i walked around to the other side and I stood at the cash register waiting as Malcolm tried to figure out how to put his \\'Winners\\' apron on. Finally, Malcolm looks at my item and says \"You\\'re returning this? You cut off the tags\". I\\'m like \"Yeah, but I bought it 12 hours ago and it doesn\\'t say on the receipt anything about keeping the tags on\". He lost it on me. He angrily pointed to this sign that Winners has that states their policy. He\\'s all like \"You cut off the tags! You\\'re not supposed to cut off the tags. We don\\'t return items with the tags cut off.\" Finally he said \"Fine, this ONE time, I\\'ll do it, but never again\". He was BY FAR one of the rudest people I have ever dealt a minute after opening. \\n\\nFinally he finished punching away at the register, shoved the receipt and cash on the counter and completely ignored me. I grabbed it and left the store immediately. \\n\\nI will never, not EVER, step foot inside this Winners again. Their service is atrocious and I urge all my fellow Yelpers to pick any place to shop but this one.',\n",

The combination of traditional spices in non traditional ways resulted in uniformly great flavors.\\n\\nWe weren't sure about ordering dessert cuz we were stuffed at this point, but the server gave us a complementary dessert platter which had cheese cake made out of cottage cheese(very decadent and I've never had this before); blueberries, and gelato ( I think). The ensuing food coma was one of the best I've ever had.\\n\\nDinner for two came to $80 with tip and tax (but sans alcohol and with complimentary dessert). Worth every penny.\",\n",

Definitely taken out of a warming tray. \\n\\nThe pancakes which was the whole reason we came here were tough! I couldn't cut thru them with a fork and i had to stop eating after 1 bite because chewing the hard shell was too much for me. \\n\\nCoffee was only refilled once. For a breakfast that costs $30, I expect it to be fresh. And I got something less than that. \\n\\nI finally settled on eating the soggy potatoes after he took my eggs away.

Price was very reasonable and the service was quick and professional. This was about 10 months ago. \\n\\nFast forward to last week, my wife and I decided to put a clear tint on my master bedroom French door windows that leads to our balcony. We wanted to do the Llumar Air 80 which we have on our front auto windshield. It is almost completely clear which should not affect our HOA as it is not reflective or dark in any way. Our main reason for wanting to do this  is for heat and UV rejection as those windows are facing west and a massive amount of heat comes into the room and whole house every afternoon til the evening hours. I remembered Brian did a standout job on our auto so I gave him a call. Surprisingly, he still remembered us and got us a quote very quickly with just the glass measurements. Made an appointment to get the job done and he was at my house bright and early the following Monday when I was available. \\n\\nYou can tell Brian loves what he does by watching the way he works. He started by trimming off all the excess glue around the window panes (glue has been there since day one when the house was built and the builders just left it like that). After that he covers the floors with plastic and sprayed soap and water on the glass and cleaned it all immaculately and carefully. If the tint was to come out perfectly he had to prep it well which he did spend a good amount of time doing. Finally the tint was put on, trimmed and bubbles squeegeed out. All in all it took a good couple of hours to do just two large windows but the results are fantastic! Room temperature was cooler almost immediately and we can really feel the difference! I'm sure this will help with our air conditioning and cooling costs but most importantly is our comfort level and with the curtains back and the blinds up, it just looks so great! \\n\\nThanks Brian for another wonderful job!

The food made it easy for us to do it though. Our waiter spoke Cantonese so it was great because my mom and grandmother barely speak English. It was a fusion restaurant so a bit of the familiar mixed with unfamiliar made for a great experience.\\n\\nIt's quite a small restaurant with not a lot of seating. Some may feel it's cramped but it wasn't a big deal.\\n\\nWe pretty much ordered half the menu. I order all 3 steamed mantou sandwiches, pork jowl skewers, confit duck wings, tea smoked duck breast, torched mackerel, fried chicken and lamb ribs.\\n\\nOut of the 3 sandwiches, I'd have to say that the brisket and pork belly were on par with one another and the chicken one was just alright. The former two were very flavorful. Each basket comes with two sandwiches.\\n\\nI think I enjoyed the pork jowl skewers the most. Just the right amount of fat for the tenderness plus it was both sweet and spicy on top of that.\\n\\nI thought the duck wings were okay. I'm used to trying the duck wings from the local grocery store and they didn't taste that much different. Not sure if I'd order it again or if I got good value.\\n\\nWhen it came to the duck breast, it didn't seem that different from the smoked duck breast that you get from the store. It just might seem like a thing regarding duck at this point. This was the most expensive thing on the menu so I expected a bit more.\\n\\nThe torched mackerel was worth it. It was tangy as most mackerel are and we spent a lot of time eating it. They said it was boneless but I found a bone here and there so be careful.\\n\\nI don't really remember how the lamb ribs were so... I'm just going to say forgettable. Might have to order it again to see if they actually were.\\n\\nThe fried chicken here was awesome. They gave us a lot and it was extremely crunchy. It was good by itself but even better with the hot sauce. The kimchi was a bit random but I like kimchi.\\n\\nMy brother and grandma enjoyed it but my mom loved it. She was so busy eating, she didn't even have time to talk. I think the bill came up to $150 for the 4 of us. So, it was a bit on the pricey side but I'd still come back after saving a little or maybe I just won't order too many expensive items.\",\n",

              " ('Worst experience EVER.  My mom and myself brought my sister in because she was still feeling awful from what her primary had diagnosed as strep throat.  The antibiotics weren\\'t helping and we thought it may be walking pneumonia.  As soon as we got in, the concierge who seemed to lack any type of enthusiasm at all got her in the system and my sister and I were directed to the next counter to get a bracelet.  Only about 10 minutes go by before she is taken back and poked and prodded.  The doctor didn\\'t say hello to my mom or myself at all, although the nurses were friendly.  We tried to explain that she may have pneumonia but he quickly dismissed us.  My sister can be rather flustered in this type of situation so we tried to help explain, but since she is 18, they wanted nothing to do with what we had to say.  They did not to an X-ray which startled the nurse who came back with her results later, but more on that down the line.  \\n\\nAfter her insurance was recorded into the system, we were hurried back out into the waiting room where a few more people had populated.  My family and I were making conversation when we noticed a couple other patients complaining about the wait, which they had been told would be a few minutes, that turned into an hour or more.  One woman white, one black *It\\'s important to know this, trust me*.  The black woman, who we learned was named Jasmine, found she was being charged for a room that she was never in.  She asked the nurse politely to speak to someone, as well as what was taking so long.  This prompted the white woman to also ask about what had taken so long seeing as her son was ill enough and like anyone in an ER setting, they wanted to get the hell out of there.  The nurse was very rude to both of them and was getting smart, so the black woman (Jasmine) asked for her name and the nurse covered her badge, but Jasmine thinking quickly, already saw it, and immediately asked for a social worker.  The social worker came out and spoke with the white woman but not to Jasmine, completely ignoring her, and worst of all, as soon as Jasmine spoke up for her right to speak to someone, with zero attitude, they called security to stand nearby just in case.\\n\\nWhile Jasmine waited, the security guard whom I had a bad feeling about, was talking major smack about Jasmine to another patient.  Completely unprofessional right off the bat.  The nurse who refused to give her name was offering blankets to people in the waiting room, all except Jasmine.  PURE RACISM!!!!!\\n\\nEventually, my sister was taken back and given her results which were mild to say the least.  The doctor had recommended that she stop her antibiotics, which is stupid.  I come from a medical background and never once has anyone thought it was a good idea to stop your AB\\'s before they are finished.  As we turned to leave we saw Jasmine crying in a corner with what I assumed was another doctor.  Jasmine ran up to my mom and said that the staff had called the cops on her and planned to have her trespassed.  My mom stayed behind because Jasmine was scared.  My sister and I went to get food and of course, by now I\\'m infuriated.  Under my breath, and directed toward my sister, I said \"piece of shit security guards\", which caught the ear of one of them.  He shouted at me as I rounded the corner out of the door.  As I exited, he came up to me, now mind you we are outside of his jurisdiction at this point as I was obviously leaving and not looking for a fight.  He came 2 inches from my face, cursing at me and telling me that he will have me trespassed.  I continued to say \"yes sir\" just to get him out of my face.  He went on about how there were sick people in this building, one of them being my sister who he was scaring the shit out of at the moment.  I walked away and returned with food for my family.  My sister was so anxiety ridden she couldn\\'t function until she got to see my mom.  She had the idea in her head that the security guard would hurt her after his little display with me.  As soon as I told my mom what had happened, she lost her shit and asked for his name.  Needless to say, they claimed not to know his name and refused to give it up but said that my mom could pick up the red security phone and ask the security department for his name.  When she did so, the phone was silent on the other end and they refused to give his name up also. \\n\\n We left and will not be back.  A police report was filed by me and my sister due to the incident with the security guard.',\n",

              " ('Debated a long time yesterday how many stars to give Blackstone, but after today\\'s discussion with my family where we again complained about the faults of yesterday\\'s dinner, I decided that two stars was the right rating. This was due to two reasons: the poor cuts of beef and the bad managerial decision.\\n\\nSteak:\\nWe ordered one of each steak cut: the tenderloin, sirloin, and the rib eye. The 8oz tenderloin was well executed and the highlight of the night. The cut was tender and juicy. However, it went downhill from there. The sirloin and the rib eye were far too tough and chewy. There were literal pieces of tendon dispersed throughout the cut, which made chewing very difficult. It wasn\\'t particularly flavourful either. The steaks were impressive merely due to the lava stones upon which they were served; they were otherwise a disappointment. \\nMy dad also ordered the lamb shank, a pitiful piece of mush that came drowning in an overly sickening sweet BBQ sauce. There was absolutely no flavour whatsoever; it was an overdone, overbraised lamb. That said, I suppose we were at fault for ordering something other than steak at a steakhouse.\\n\\nService:\\nWe came to celebrate my sister\\'s birthday; I had called in advance to let then know and asked whether there would be any dessert or celebration. The manager had mentioned that they could bring a cake with a birthday song and decorate it nicely - just to let him know upon arrival. I did just that, but decided to confirm whether the celebration would be on the house. He said that it wouldn\\'t be, which is totally fine, so I told him that I\\'d reconsider and let him know later. Halfway during the meal, he walks by with a pat on my shoulder, assuring me that he \"will take care of it\". From that, I assumed that he decided to provide the cake on the house, and was delighted. You can imagine my shock when I see the $8 charge on the bill at the end! While the celebration was a nice gesture, I never explicitly asked for it. That was because I didn\\'t feel that a measly small piece of cake was worth $8, no matter how good. For him to make a decision on my behalf - the customer\\'s behalf - is simply unacceptable.\\nThe servers, though friendly, had difficulties understanding our order. The sides for the steak were switched, so we had to go through the trouble of righting their mistakes. Moreover, they just kept checking in on us, which almost felt as if they were breathing down our necks a bit. It was slightly pushy and overwhelming. \\nFinally, the table space was very tight. There was simply insufficient room for all the plates and stones. However, despite our raising of this point, they simply dismissed it. The cramped table simple made dining there uncomfortable.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nIf you\\'re craving a good steak, I would not choose this place. If you\\'re interested in the experience of the lava stone, then sure, come and try. I won\\'t come again only because I feel that we were ripped off with the sudden charge and delivery of the birthday cake.',\n",

Come to find out the shuttle ran every half hour which is horrible, & only sat 12 ppl so if you were the 13th you would have to wait until the next one came which was a whole half an hour later AND it stopped running at 8 so if you wanted to leave your hotel after 8 or come back from the strip to your hotel after 8 that\\'s a 12 dollar cab with cash, 15 with a card (for a mile long ride!). You can see how hanging out after 8 outside of your hotel can add up in cab fees if there\\'s only 2 of you like it was for me.\\n\\n2) When checking in there were only two receptionists and they moved pretty damn slow. We checked in, I want to say around 11pm, which is probably why there were only two staff but it\\'s a hotel, it\\'s Vegas, people are checking in all the time, so the wait for that was a little ridiculous.\\n\\n3) The wifi was Blahhh, it was very slow and I had to enter my name and room number constantly to keep connecting back to it... Annoying!\\n\\n4) The food wasn\\'t cheap at all, it was 45 bucks for my boyfriend and I to eat at the buffet which I thought would have been fitting for two ppl that didn\\'t stay in the hotel opposed to two ppl that did BUT I will say that they served endless champagne which diffused the situation for me, they did good with that (finally!)\\n\\n5) There was a $20 fee a night so when I was checking out that was $80 for me but they attempted to charge us for a Gatorade and some other item that we never used which hiked up the price. After we told them we hadn\\'t used anything in the mini bar they did take those items off of the bill. Twenty dollars a night is still kind of ridiculous after paying hundreds of dollars for the hotel room already, don\\'t you think?\\n\\n6) At this point I\\'m done talking about this place! There are already too many deterring points I\\'ve made about this hotel that I just do not feel like continuing. On the ups the room was nice and newly renovated and we had two beds when we only needed one, the bathroom was really nice and the tv had cable so good job on that I guess. We were able to do one party at the \"Moon something\" for free after putting ourselves on the guest list. The party itself was a little corny but the rooftop view was pretty cool.\\n\\n7) All in all if you MUST stay here it won\\'t be your worst experience, especially if you\\'re richer than me, lol, but I would recommend staying somewhere on the strip, it\\'s much more convenient, some of the hotels are less expensive, and you won\\'t have to worry about carfare after 8pm!

Despite the small walk-through space and single bathroom, you can't go wrong with the tinted lighting, wood and brick walls, and open kitchen concept, making for a very welcoming dining atmosphere.\\n\\nThe food is slightly on the pricey side, with an average dish ranging from $25-37 depending on what you order. But the portions are well worth every dollar. One dish is enough to satisfy a big eater; two dishes will induce food coma. And when you're dealing with meats slow cooked to perfection, marinated with simple yet delicious flavours, and well complimenting sides, it can get very easy to get carried away with wanting to try everything.\\n\\nI sat down with five other friends, all of us guys and in Montreal for a bachelor party (attention bachelor party planners, this is the perfect place for dinner). They sat us near the open window, which for a warm evening was great. It gave us room to breathe and a good view of the restaurant or of the street depending on where we looked.\\n\\nAfter a round of beers, we shared a Boudin Tart and a Duck Carpaccio. The tart crust was light and crispy topped with caramel onion, potato, and blood sausage cooked to perfection. The foie gras drizzle on top made for a light but wonderfully complex marriage of flavours and the dish was shared evenly among us. The Duck Carpaccio went as quickly as it appeared. The thinly sliced pieces of raw duck signified meat of the highest quality and flavour, and it was balanced out with an egg yolk, olive oil, mushrooms, capers, and mushrooms.\\n\\nThe main dishes were equally spectacular. The PDC cut was a roast so big, it had to share it. It was cooked very well. A crispy flavourful exterior with a well done first layer down to a juicy medium rare interior. The veal rib was a massive, single rib with melt off the bone, tender, and astoundingly seasoned meat. My duck magret in mushroom sauce was absolutely spectacular. The sauce was a light white wine flavouring, thinly sliced mushrooms covering thin slices of duck cooked medium rare. With each slice, the flavour of the duck became more noticeable.\\n\\nDessert was light, since by this point we were all stuffed. I ordered a maple toffee milkshake. It wasn't big; served in the same glass as our beer. It was a frothy shake, not thick, but it also had a light, non-invasive sweetness. The toffee flavour came from a thick piece of toffee that sat in the shake and could be eaten at any time. It was a satisfying end to a satisfying meal.\\n\\nThe star lost was mainly due to the poor service we got from the main waitress. The bus boy was fantastic. He promptly refilled our water and got us more bread than we could stomach. The runner was equally pleasant. But the main waitress had a bit of attitude from her greeting, was not helpful in any way, and never came back to check on us. If it weren't for her assisted helpers, we would have had no interaction with any staff. Also, we were warned that the PDC cut would take 50 minutes to prepare, but after an hour of waiting, no one came with an update. I can see how this would have turned off tourists from recommending the place, or from wrecking the dining experience.\\n\\nHowever, Au Pied de Cochon has quickly become a go to place whenever I'm in Montreal. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is great, and when you talk about value, I wouldn't have been angry if the prices were even higher than they are considering the quality. I highly recommend this place!\",\n",

While it sounded strange, we didn't say anything at the moment.  Later when she brought our food, I asked if the hummus was really made with peanuts or maybe she meant chickpeas?   She said she had to ask the kitchen and get back to us.  Overall, our food was okay, but nothing great.

They also have a terrasse that looks like it would be a nice place to sit in warmer months.\\n\\nWhile there are some non-pork based dishes like beef tartare and duck I thought it best to see if the restaurant does a good job with pork products.  That meant that I ordered the tomahawk, which was a pork chop garnished with apple sauce and served with a sweet potato puree.  I enjoyed the flavours of the dish but I felt that the meat was a little overdone as it was on the tough and chewy side.  The portion was pretty big so I'm glad I skipped the appetizer since that would have been overkill.  I also tried a mouthful of my friend's ribs which were really tender.\\n\\nDessert was a brownie served with caramel bacon ice cream.  The ice cream was really good and I liked how the salty and sweet balanced each other out.  The tiny chunks of bacon also added a nice touch.  The brownie on the other hand was rock hard and impossible to eat with the spoon they gave me.  It was really dense and chocolatey so that was what seemed to give it that hard texture but I would have traded some of that for something that was softer and easier to eat.\\n\\nThe service was great.  Our server seemed to know the menu inside and out and he did a great job with recommendations.  Everything arrived in a timely fashion and he did check on us regularly to see how we were doing.\\n\\nPrices were okay but I felt that since my dishes weren't the greatest they could have been better.  I think the restaurant definitely has potential but it does need to work on its execution a bit.  The experience as a whole was just okay.  Nothing awful but nothing excellent either.\",\n",

I love hollandaise and they are not skimpy with it, ham actually has flavor, perfect poach eggs. I tried the crab cake version too, and surprised I liked the original better. The corned beef hash was another we tried and I thought it was tasty. I love their potatoes the brekkies come with and the bagels of their name sake actually are quite nice. \\n\\nThen I decided to try their corned beef sandwich and was prepared to be only mildly satisfied. I have a little Jewish corner of my heart that beats for childhood Saturdays at Langer's. The corned beef was flavorful, juicy and the marbled bread I chose was great. I always eat mine with  coleslaw and Russian dressing (aka thousand island). I'm normally into pickles, but theirs is closer to cucumber than pickle so I'm not the most fond of it. The sandwich was so good, I was a bit sad to  share with the BF and take the other half of the benedict even though I love the bennie. \\n\\nSo we came back several more times to get our own. I have to say that the way to go is the soup and half sandwich deal ($10.95- $11.95). It actually comes out cheaper with more food since the sandwich was just as big as a 1/4th lb, you get soup and can even get a side if you wish for $1. The matzo ball soup here is decent, and the sweet and sour stuffed cabbage was nice though I dropped my phone in it trying to Yelp it. We also tried the lobster salad sandwich and that was solid, but I'm gonna stay with the meat sandwiches..... I should mention I lean towards mostly eating vegetarian and this place is testing it. \\n\\nService is pretty decent on checking up. We also don't go during busy times as this is the type of place that gets swamped during regular breakfast/lunch hours on weekends. Beat the busy by heading in a bit later in the afternoon. \\n\\nWhile the sandwich and benedict have been stellar, the dessert counter has been extreme highs and lows so much so that I can't justify a 5star. \\n\\nThe best: The rugulach are awesomely good. I normally don't like chocolate ones but I love them here, the almond ones are great, all the fruit ones are great. There is not a bad one so even though it is priced per pound, I feel this is worth it. \\nThe subpar: I'm not fond of the black and white cookie being more like cake. I know a lot of delis do this and I'm just more of a shadortbred person.  The rainbow cookies were okay, but not quite up to my standard with it being too wet though the sponge flavor was right on (those are one of my favorite deli sweets). The homemade twinkie was a bit dry.\\n The bad: we got a slice of buttercream cake which was painfully sweet with the frosting tasting like boxed. It was thick, sticky and you can feel sugar granules in it with the cake itself also rather sweet. It was a throwaway so I will not be getting anything else but rugulachs. The desserts aren't cheap for what they are...Spent $27 with only the rugulachs being the only thing we are gonna eat the entirety of. \\n\\nThis is great place and I do highly recommend this as a go-to if you're in the area, just know how to navigate the deli and massive menu through recommendations.\",\n",

Price came to about $8. I originally wanted to try their milk tea waffle but it was unavailable at the time. I was surprised to find their cappuccino waffle to actually taste like coffee. The base was crispy and aromatic with strong coffee flavour in every bite. The sesame ice cream is decent, not really packed with intense sesame flavour but the flavour was there.

I don't consider this a good deal. When I grade breakfast burritos I look at three things: meat to egg/potato ratio, flavor, and size. Unfortunately I don't  think this burrito grades well anywhere. There isn't enough meat, you can't taste the bacon, the middle of the burrito tasted like mush, and the burrito overall was small. I would recommend skipping the bfast burrito.

I use the word 'famous' because they are heavily embellished with awards even from the Thai Royal government and had serviced big screen celebrities like Jackie Chan, Jessica Alba and the list goes on. Head chef Sasi was an iron chef winner and is celebrity status herself.\\n\\nWith such an adorned list of accomplishments, we arrived ready to culinarily enlighten. Once you walk up the stairs into the restaurant, the place has an old antique feeling to it like a mashup of a Thai temple and a traditional diner. A little worn but lots of traditional flair.\\n\\nTheir menu had a lot going on as it was so wordy that it was a little hard to navigate through. We decided to place our full trust in our servers recommendations and ordered the most popular items:\\n\\n- Tom yum soup: this was the most sour Tom yum I have ever had. The sourness was so overpowering that it was hard for me to enjoy any other flavour that accompanied it.\\n- Divine crispy morning glory: battered thai spinach, it was fried similar to tempura style with a nice sweet and sour glaze. I thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommend.\\n- Sasi's red curry chicken with lychee: served in a pineapple and had lychee in the curry, interesting concept but can't say I was a fan. The taste was a little bland and it didn't have a strong flavour profile. The chicken meat was also slightly overcooked. \\n- Sasi's pad Thai: the noodles were nice and chewy and it was a solid pad thai but again there wasn't a distinctiveness that would make me want to get it again.\\n\\nOverall, it was still a satisfying meal and I wouldn't go as far to say this is a tourist trap because I'm sure Sasi is a super talented and great chef.

The first time I rode the light rail I took it from Mill Ave to Phoenix to see the D-Backs and Cubs play. My friends had caught a tram in Mesa so I sat there and watched a few trams come and go before I got onto the one with my friends on it. That was easy enough...there was enough room for me and the ride was smooth and fun (though I can't say it was relaxing)...Any ways. After the game was quite an experience! The tram ride home was a little more crowed now that the game had let out. There were two die hard fans in our car from the two teams who started talking trash to each other...well one of them had a little too much to drink and one thing lead to another and they were soon yelling threats at each other. Right before the drunker one took a swing (in a very crowded car) an older man stood up and shut them both up before someone got hurt...the tension in the air was thick the whole way back to Tempe where the Cub fan got off and punched the window. The friends of the other guy had to hold him back...I mean come on!! \\n\\nOkay, then I had the pleasure of using the light rail to go to the Circus. Again I was headed to Phoenix but this time I got on at the Washington stop. It was again a fun ride, but I couldn't say that it was a relaxing ride...there was this bum who was asking people for money and I think it would be better with some music playing in the background...any ways the ride home wasn't as eventful as the baseball game crowd, but again, there was another bum asking for money...can people just ride in peace?\\n\\nI like the light rail - I really do...it's always an interesting experience, but I just don't feel safe on it. I used to take the metro bus from Gilbert to Mesa every day for a while and I felt safer on that then I do on the light rail and the bums who ride the bus don't ask me for money either.\",\n",

When I went to pick it up, the cost came up to $120.00. I was in shock and had to re-budget my rent for this month for this shocking repair cost.

The rep at service desk was very pleasant and helpful. And promised to take care of the repair without charge, under warranty and that the suit would be ready in a few days. Later that day, I received a call from a MEC manager to tell me that's not going to happen and accused me of taking advantage of the shop for multiple gaskets repairs and not paying for them. That they do not cover wear and tear. Wear and tear? It was worn 3 times and was torn again! As if it's normal for their service to hold up for 3 wears. Did I mention the drysuit was $1000.00?

Then the order gets stopped in billing due to the same missing documentation. I'm always informed that they will update the file and they don't follow through. Numerous times I've called my insurance company to talk to edgepark with me on the line and supposedly is fixed. On the 1st I call in and low and behold they need the medical necessity. I seem to get the run around. They continually put my order on a hold I'm constantly having to tell them I'm on his last can and by the time I recieve the shipment my 6 month old infant out down to his last few bottles. Why?  How can a company be so incompetent that they cannot update the information on file that they already have in the system?  Why do I have to fight with them every single month?  This past month I called on the 27th to place the order. Customer service supposedly sends the order 4 days pass no package I called back they said I never placed an order. I get switched from one person to another they finally fess up that the order was rotated through 4 customer service reps and then canceled. Why wasn't I informed?

Sage, located in the Aria hotel, has a relatively unassuming entrance, but that belies that grandeur to be found inside.  The restaurant is immense, with high ceilings, sumptuous furnishings, and a gorgeous color scheme with lots of golds accents and stunning chandeliers.  Needless to say, Sage is just as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the taste buds. \\n\\nAfter we were seated, our incredibly friendly and kind server, John, came by with the breadbasket.  We each had the sourdough roll and a bacon brioche -- and both were excellent.  They were served with sea salt (served on a tablespoon) and whipped butter. \\n\\nDeciding what to order was easy as pie -- we both had the 4-course tasting menu ($79).  My dinner companion splurged on the wine pairing ($39).  Our server\\'s wine pours were *very* generous -- a lot more than the advertised half glass per course .  In fact, I was able to enjoy some wine with every course without bothering to order the wine pairing myself. \\n\\nBelow is a run-down of everything that we ate.  Absolutely everything was cooked and presented with the utmost class and sophistication.  The refinement of this dinner was unlike anything I\\'d previously experienced.\\n\\n**AMUSE BOUCHE ... PRE-DINNER**\\nA shot glass of gazpacho.  Fresh and tangy.  A wonderful starter.\\n\\n**COURSE #1**\\nWagyu beef tartare with buttered crostini.  Easily the finest tartare I\\'ve ever had.  The beef was unctuous and fresh; the egg only added to the indulgence.  Chocolate shavings provided an unexpected layer of complexity.\\n\\n**COURSE #2**\\nSeared Maine dayboat scallops with broccolini, braised oxtail, mushrooms, and caramel reduction.  The scallops were cooked beautifully and fall apart when touched with a fork.  The broccolini was tender.  The caramel sauce provided an intriguing sweetness that contrasted against the saltiness of the shellfish.\\n\\n**COURSE #3**\\n48 hour beef belly with braised apples.  I\\'ve never had beef this tender and succulent in my life.  Each bite dissolves on your palate and overwhelms you with flavor.  Apples provide a gentle acidity that works well against the umami of the beef.\\n\\n**COURSE #4**\\nPistachio tart with strawberry ice cream.  A culinary work of art -- oodles of individual components meticulously arranged.  Bold, fresh flavors all over the plate.  An enjoyable juxtaposition of hot and cold. \\n\\n**AMUSE BOUCHE ... POST-DINNER**\\nHot white chocolate with mint and coconut, served in a white porcelain shot glass.  A sweet, uplifting treat at the end of a fantastic meal.\\n\\nAfter this meal, I wasn\\'t just full and satisfied -- I was exhilarated, knowing that I had a world-class gastronomic experience.  The staff at Sage earned every penny of their tip.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t the sort of meal I can have everyday -- but it\\'s worth doing once in a while, if for no other reason to remind yourself that fine dining can truly be life-changing.\\n\\nIf you subscribe to the \"you only live once\" philosophy, than a dinner at Sage is a must.',\n",

The staff took their time with me, showing me lots of options, and helping me take them out on the sidewalk to test. They were patient and kind. \\n\\nMy bike has been amazing, great quality, perfect for my needs. I had shopped around a lot (I had gone to about 12 different shops and stores) when I was looking for my first bike, and the bike prices here were really outstanding. \\n\\nWhen I went back in to get it tuned up, they got it done in just 15 minutes - I am not sure this can always be done so quickly, but certainly I was impressed and very pleased. \\n\\nI noticed one negative review about the prices for accessories - I have to agree that accessories seemed a bit pricey here, and have bought my lights, helmet, etc. from MEC which has very reasonable prices. \\n\\nWhen it comes to buying a new or used bike, and getting it serviced, I can't recommend this place enough.\",\n",

              " (\"So I had a consultation to get my lips to a luscious shape that I have always wanted. My appointment was May 23. It was supposed to be May 22 but the doctors offices called and asked if I could switch it to the 23 which was no problem. I was greeted by a very nice, sweet, professional lady (I am so sorry I forgot your name) she handed me my paperwork and said if I had questions don't hesitate to ask. I waited about 5 minutes and I was greeted by Blanca (I only remember her cause I have her card). She took me back to an examination room and asked what brings me to them. I told her I wanted nice big lips but not fake. She said she knew exactly what I met. She said your lips are definitely small and could use a little something lol. She had me at that answer. Honestly is the best policy! We went through two different fillers I could use and the prices. She handed me what she quoted me on and I am set up to have my lips done June 26th! She showed me two ladies that worked in the office(I am so so sorry I forgot your names) that had there lips done and they were gorgeous. I have read the reviews on here and it scares me a little but personally I had a great experience. I also did my research:)\",\n",

              " (\"Okay, honestly, Honey Bear's couldn't hang in Memphis, Birmingham, Houston, or Lockhart  ... and fortunately for them, they don't need to 'hang' because they are smoking their meats in the BBQ wasteland of Phoenix, AZ.  \\n\\nBecause I fancy myself a BBQ expert (note: I'm more of a brisket purist), its difficult to rate HB's based on the integrity of the THEIR OWN meat and not as a comparison to others Valley and Nation-wide. This is exactly 'why' I think many of their rating suffer because everyone has undoubtedly had better BBQ elsewhere, wherever you may hail from, and it takes a stringent push from one's own natural reflexes to resist matching HBs up to 'local awesome BBQ joint'.  BBQ connoisseurs are funny like that.\\n\\nSo, overall, HB's earns a 3-star based on the following:\\n\\nPork Ribs - I'm more of a beef rib expert, but these ribs were generous and plentiful in their combo plate.  I was surprised that there was very likely a whole half-rack on my plate.  They are very tasty even without the sauce, with a nice peppery rub that did not dry out the meat.\\n\\nSmoked Chicken - Juicy but slightly greasy.  This is amongst the most difficult smoked meat to pull off due to the propensity for it to become a stringy, dehydrated mess.  I don't think I would order it again, but the flavor was pretty decent and I don't regret trying it.\\n\\nPulled Pork - I got a 1/2 lb of pulled pork as a side meat, along with a couple of extra buns to make as a half-sandwich (a glob of meat on a half bun, folded over like a taco).  This is the only time I typically use sauce to counterbalance the white bread, whether its pork, brisket, or sausage.  I was surprised by how dry the pork was, particularly because pork is fatty and juicy, but here at HB's it was extra lean.  I thought I would hate the pork bc of this fact, but the sauce saves it from being a choking bolus of pig and flour.  Now I understand why they typically put this on a full bun and drown it in sauce.  As the 'specialty' of this restaurant, its kind of a gaffe that the quality is poor, but as a consumer, I'd order it again in limited amounts, and only as a 'side'.  Why?  Because I can provide my own perfect ratio of bread:pork:sauce.  Otherwise, I don't think that HB's could build me a pulled pork sandwich I could be happy with.\\n\\nSauce - If you don't know any better you'd think it was tip-top.  Sure, its 'pretty good', but its most-definitely a one-note mixture.  Too sweet for their peppery rubs.  A spicier sauce would do the trick better, IMO.\\n\\nCorn on the Cob - Serviceable, but soggy and strangely devoid of spices typical of southern cuisine.\\n\\nCowbro Beans - Awesome.  Smokey flavor, thick sauce, and chunks of their smoked sausage.  Great compliment to a BBQ dinner.\\n\\nSoda Fountain - The city's best.  BBQ restaurant staples such as 1a) Dr Pepper 1b) Big Red.  Their 'cola' is RC and they have Hines Rootbeer, Sunkist, Country Time Lemonade, and 7-Up.  They did some solid research on the fluid necessities of BBQ palates.  They also have a fridge of beer.\\n\\nPrice -  All that, which I described above came out to $33 with a large tip because the guy behind the counter was very cool.  It fed two hungry people during the season finale of LOST, with plenty extra for leftovers.  Very pleased in this area.\\n\\nOverall - Hey, its PHX, and here we are better adapted to 'fill-ins' for our favorite spots back home.  It happens in every culinary category, from philly cheesesteaks to fish n chips; gnocchi to Q.  Why should this place be any different?\",\n",

I scheduled with both, signed in and indicated both their names and I also told the front desk that I am scheduled with both ladies. I was called back by the lady who does my pedicures and she stared my manicure instead. I was confused but I assumed the front desk arranged this because my manicure lady had just starts applying polish a few seats away on another customer. I had no problem with that and was willing to stay a little longer because I knew it was worth having the lady do both. Front desk came by and apologized for not telling the technician that I had scheduled with both and that it would take longer. I had no problem because mix ups happen and it was the first mishap anyway. As the lady is doing my pedicure she asked why I didn\\'t notify her that someone else is doing my manicure.

I advised that it was a misunderstanding and again she raised her voice and said \"next time, you have to tell me\" in a very rude tone and I had about 4-5 technicians along with their customers staring at me.

I'll get 2 or 3 depending on how hungry I am.  Last night I enjoyed the Gorgonzola Prosciutto Chips which were very tasty, even if I am 99% sure it was just ham and not prosciutto (lol).  The Gorgonzola sauce is the bomb.  I seriously wanted to lick my plate.\\nTheir beers are good and I am not a beer drinker at all.  My husband ordered their new pumpkin spice brew and I kept stealing sips, it was so delicious!\\nThis location has fantastic atmosphere, being in the middle of the hopping section of Mill Ave.  That being said, parking is horrific on a Friday night.

Besides the steaks some of my companions also enjoyed their black cod. We wanted to share with our guests the pride of the Montreal cuisine, the roast beef poutine.

For a newly opened restaurant the service was seamless - and even more than that - friendly and generous as we were given an additional appetiser dish on the house. It was a mushroom salad with yuzu dressing that wasn't on the menu but the chef wanted us to try it - and it should be! \\nWe ordered the Korean pancake (vegetarian), the beef bulgogi, 2x bibimbaps, the tofu and kimchi stew (a fave), and the sweet potato glass noodles (another fave!) and there was plenty of food! Along with the complimentary mushroom salad, we were given kimchi, and some pickles to start and also had cold roasted corn tea (delicious!) so I would say this was a very well priced meal around $25 per person. The food was all very tasty and the portions were generous - we were 5 and we had plenty to try from each dish. \\nThey are yet to obtain a liquor license so we did not drink. \\nI am very happy this restaurant has opened and I wish them every success!

My family has purchased multiple cars via him. He is the best dealer at this Hyundai location and really goes above and beyond for his customers. Unfortunately, the customer service provided by his fellow peers do not match his. Hopefully, the story below will defer first time buyers like me away from a bad dealership with terrible customer service. \\n\\n7/31 Took a hiking trip and made it back home safely when this brand-new car under 7,000 miles battery died. This was odd for me because it is a brand-new car so I didn\\'t understand why the car just died. All my key fobs were not working and no power to the entire car. At this point I was fine because I knew it would be fixed under the warranty. Called Antonio to let him know what was going on, he advised me that I had roadside assistance for 5 years so I called to get the battery jumped, and it didn\\'t work so Antonio asked me to bring the car to the dealership. After arriving there I was immediately greeted (if that\\'s what you call it) with distasteful customer service. A service clerk named Linda chastised me and the representative from the towing company with a negative tone basically asking why we were there and blocking her service area instead of directing us where we needed to go, saw that we were being serviced already and passed us off in an extremely rude manner. Mind you I later saw her help three other customers with the exact opposite kind of attitude, so it\\'s not like she was having a bad day, I\\'m assuming we were just a problem for her. My normal service representative was busy so I was passed off to another rep to assist in getting a courtesy car. I had to go to get the car myself, and also received it with no gas, after telling the rep three times, he then had it filled. No one asked if I needed help with anything else, or told me when I should be expecting my vehicle, NO ONE ASKED ME FOR THE KEY TO MY CAR AT A CAR DEALERSHIP, and my problems seemed to be an inconvenience to every and anyone at the dealership.\\n\\n8/2 Went to pick-up the vehicle and showed up with no one inside the facility. After searching, I found the General Manager of the branch who proceeded to walk me to the service area to get my vehicle, I knew he had heard of my experience previously, so out of knowledge of \"good\" customer service, I expected him to ask what happened, but he seemed to show no interest in it.
